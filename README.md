# Number Avalanche
I don't know what to call this

NOTE: you need to change a comment "#path" to the path you want your files to be saved in

Description:
You need to enter 2 numbers. The program will do its thing and output a file containing your avalanche of numbers.

I dunno just thought it looks cool.
